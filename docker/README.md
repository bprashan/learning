##  **Getting Started**

Begin with **[01-docker-basics](./01-docker-basics/)** and work through each section systematically.

Each section builds upon the previous one, ensuring you develop both theoretical understanding and practical skills that employers value in senior DevOps roles.

>  **Remember**: The goal isn't just to learn Docker commands, but to understand how to architect, deploy, and maintain containerized applications in production environments.

**Happy Dockerizing! **
